{"prompt": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?", "best response": ["Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me? I'm just a nerd with a bad shoulder!\nLet me do a quick rundown of the rules of kickball, so you know what to expect. The game is played on a softball diamond, with the same bases, lines, and outfield positions. Two teams of nine players compete, with 12 outfielders. The nine players in the infield are split into three positions: kickers, catchers, and fielders. Kickers are the front line, and they throw balls from behind home plate. Catchers are behind the batter, catching the balls. The fielders are positioned around the bases to catch any balls that get by the kickers and catchers.\nKickball is played the same as baseball, except that each player kicks the ball with his or her foot instead of hitting it with a bat. The kickers must stay in a straight line, and they cannot kick the ball over the bases or into the outfield. They can kick the ball anywhere between their feet and the pitcher\u2019s mound. If they kick the ball too far away from the mound, the opposing team can hit it with a bat, and if it goes past the outfield, the batter gets another kick.\nThe game is mostly played like baseball. The teams take turns kicking, and the first team to score 21 points wins. When a team scores a run, the kicker must kick the ball from the opposite end of the bases. If the ball is kicked between the bases, it is called a base hit, and the kicker gets a new turn on the bases. If the ball is kicked past the first or third base, it is called a foul ball, and the kicker must kick it from the foul line.\nThere are a few other rules, too. For example, the kicker cannot kick the ball in any direction that would cause it to go past the pitcher\u2019s mound. If the ball goes past the pitcher\u2019s mound, it is called a strike, and the kicker must kick the ball from the mound. The kicker also cannot kick the ball past the first base, or past the third base. If the ball goes past those bases, it is called a foul ball, and the kicker must kick the ball from the foul line.\nKickball is a great game for any age group, and it is a great way to get kids to exercise. The game is safe, and it can be played year-round, so it is a great way to keep kids active during the summer months.\nThe best part about kickball is that it\u2019s easy to learn and play. The rules are simple and easy to understand, so you can get started right away. You don\u2019t need any special equipment, and you don\u2019t need to be a professional athlete to play. You just need a ball and a few people to play with.\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for a fun game to play with your friends, look no further than kickball.\n1 What is the point of kickball?\n2 How do you play kickball?\n3 What is the difference between kickball and baseball?\n4 How do you win a kickball game?\n5 How do you play kickball with 6 people?\n6 What happens if you get kicked out of kickball?\n7 Do you have to play kickball?\nWhat is the point of kickball?\nWhat is the point of kickball?\nKickball is a game that is played by two teams of equal size.
