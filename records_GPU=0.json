{"index": 15, "prompt": "I want to get better at networking at work", "best response": "I want to get better at networking at work. What are some good techniques that can help me?\nI'm going to assume you're looking to get better at doing things like talking to people who are in your extended network, and not just connecting with people through the usual channels, like email. There are a couple of approaches you can take.\nThe big one is to just start doing it. Don't be afraid to talk to people and see what happens. You'll make some mistakes, but you may learn something in the process.\nAnother thing to do is to get used to the whole concept of networking, and that involves a certain amount of preparation. Here's a checklist of things to do before you embark on any sort of networking campaign.\nKnow why you're doing it. What are the goals? What are you hoping to achieve? If you don't know, you might as well not bother.\nHave a plan. If you don't know where you're going, you're not going to get there, no matter how hard you try. Be sure to include things like what you're going to say, who you're going to talk to, where you're going to talk to them, when, and how.\nKnow what you want to get out of the encounter. This is different from knowing your goals, which are more general. This is about what you're going to get out of a particular conversation. For instance, are you looking for a job? If so, what kind of job? What kind of company? What kind of field?\nKnow what you have to offer. You're not just talking to people just because you think you'll get stuff out of them. You're going to have to give them something in return. What are you going to give them? What have you got to offer? Why should they want to talk to you?\nKnow your audience. You should know who you're going to be talking to, and what kind of people they are. Are they people you'd normally talk to at work? If you're not sure, do a little research.\nKnow your own limitations. If you're going to be talking to people you don't know, you should probably do a little research on them. What kind of work do they do? What kind of people are they? What sort of things do they talk about? What sort of things are they interested in? What sort of things do they like? What sort of things do they hate?\nBe prepared. Have a good opening line. You should be able to describe yourself in a sentence or two. You should be able to say what you do. You should be able to say what kind of people you're interested in talking to. You should be able to say what kind of people you'd like to talk to.\nBe prepared to listen.
