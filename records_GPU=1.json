{"index": 4, "prompt": "How do I wrap a present neatly?", "best response": "How do I wrap a present neatly? There are two ways to wrap presents neatly.\n1. Start by folding the paper in half. You can either fold it over the top or the side of the box, depending on whether you want the paper to be visible when the present is opened or not.\n2. Cut the paper so that there is enough to cover both sides of the box. You may need to cut more than one piece of paper if your box is large or shaped oddly.\n3. Wrap the box in the paper, making sure that there are no wrinkles or creases. If you are wrapping a rectangular box, you should use a square piece of paper and fold it up over the top and sides of the box.\n4. Secure the paper in place with tape or ribbon. This will ensure that the wrapping stays on until the present is opened.", "score": 0.08203125, "num_tokens": 81317, "avg_num_tokens": 677.6416666666667}

Retinoids are also effective in preventing new acne lesions from forming.\nWhile retinoids are effective in reducing acne lesions, they are not a cure for acne. Retinoids should be used in combination with other treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide or antibiotics, to achieve the best results. Retinoids should also be used as part of a comprehensive acne treatment plan that includes proper skincare and lifestyle changes.\nRetinoids can also cause side effects, such as dryness, irritation, and redness.

{"index": 19, "prompt": "I am going to try to roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving this year. What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted?", "best response": "I am going to try to roast a pig at home for Thanksgiving this year. What equipment and techniques do I need to successfully get a pig roasted? I have a 25 gallon propane tank for a grill, and would like to try to roast the pig with this. I have done a lot of research on the internet, but have not found any good information on how to go about roasting a pig. I have a pretty good sized covered patio off the back of my house that I could use as a staging area to set up whatever I would use to cook the pig. Any information would be helpful!\nHere is some great info on roasting a pig.\u00a0 If you have any further questions you may want to call the folks at the local meat store where you buy your meat.\u00a0 They should have some great ideas for you.\nThe first thing to realize is that we are not really roasting the pig, but rather cooking it in the ground.\nWe will be baking it, really, but the term \"roasting\" in this case is used because of the equipment we use to cook the pig.\nThe cooking time varies, but a small pig will take about 6 hours, while a large pig will need around 10 hours. The temperature of the pit should remain between 250 and 300 degrees. The pig is cooked when the internal temperature registers 180 degrees in the breast area. The pig is ready to serve when the temperature of the breast reaches 180 degrees. This is the internal temperature of the pig, not the surface temperature. The temperature of the pig will be about 20 degrees higher than the surface temperature of the pit. This is very important, so don't forget it! If you are roasting a large pig, it is a good idea to have an extra pig roaster on hand in case the first one burns out.\nIf you are roasting a pig over an open fire, you will need a pit of some sort. The pit can be made from any material that will prevent the heat of the fire from escaping and will allow the pig to be cooked evenly. The pit should be at least 3 feet deep, 4 feet wide and 6 feet long. The length of the pit should be longer than the pig. The pit should be lined with rocks, bricks or other materials that will insulate it from the heat. The pit should be dug so the side walls are sloping, so the heat can circulate around the pig. The bottom of the pit should be lined with fireproof materials such as fire bricks, fire clay or fireproof cement.
