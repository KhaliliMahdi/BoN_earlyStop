Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me? I'm a guy who is 6'4 and 195 lbs, and I've never played kickball before.\nYou're absolutely right to be cautious, since kickball is a game played by women for women. It's not a manly game, except in the sense that you get to wear a cup. If you do play, you'll find that you have no control over your leg, because kickball is not played with your toes, and you'll be kicked in the groin. A lot. The good news is that the woman will probably not get hurt as much as you will. And it will happen so fast, you won't even know what hit you.", "score": 0.08935546875, "num_tokens": 129974, "avg_num_tokens": 1083.1166666666666}

{"prompt": "How do I wrap a present neatly?", "best response": "How do I wrap a present neatly? What\u2019s the best way to wrap a gift box? How to wrap gifts for a baby shower? How to wrap a gift for Christmas? How to wrap a gift for a birthday? What are the rules for gift wrapping?\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered about the answers to these questions, then you\u2019ve probably wondered why people go through so much effort to wrap their gifts. Of course, the answer to that question is pretty simple: it\u2019s because we want our gifts to look good when they are opened. When your gift is well-wrapped, everyone will know that you put a lot of effort into it, and that you\u2019re a true friend. And you\u2019ll be happy to know that it doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort to wrap a gift just right. In fact, there are only four basic steps to wrapping a gift, and they\u2019re really easy to learn.\nStep 1: Choose the right wrapping paper. This might seem obvious, but it\u2019s not. There are many different kinds of wrapping paper, and not all of them are good for wrapping gifts. The best ones to use are those that are sturdy and easy to tear. You don\u2019t want to use wrapping paper that\u2019s so thin and light that it gets ripped as soon as you tear into it. Instead, choose wrapping paper that\u2019s strong enough to hold up to a lot of tearing and shredding.\nStep 2: Get the right packaging. Again, this might sound obvious, but it\u2019s worth mentioning. The best wrapping paper is the kind that you can use for any kind of gift. This means that you can use it for a birthday present, a wedding present, or anything else you want to give someone. Just make sure that the wrapping paper you choose isn\u2019t too heavy or too light, and that it\u2019s not too wide or too narrow. You also want to make sure that the wrapping paper you choose is easy to tear.\nStep 3: Get the right wrapping tape. This is another thing that might seem obvious, but it\u2019s worth mentioning.

{"prompt": "How do I dice without slicing my finger", "best response": "How do I dice without slicing my finger off?\nI have yet to dice an onion without cutting myself with my knife. I have tried so many different techniques and all seem to end up with at least a little blood. I am pretty sure my knife is sharp. I have tried dicing over a cutting board, dicing on a plate, dicing on a cutting board with the cutting board over a towel, dicing on a cutting board while holding a towel, dicing on a cutting board while holding a towel while on top of a cutting board, dicing on a plate while holding a towel, etc.\nIs there a proper technique for dicing an onion that will avoid cutting myself?\nFor what it's worth, I have tried dicing an onion with a small knife (just for fun, to see if it would be easier), and I still cut myself.\nMy knife is a very sharp, standard chef's knife.\nI'm not sure if this is a duplicate, but I think it's close enough that it's useful to ask this question.\nI'm not sure what you're doing wrong. I dice onions all the time without cutting myself. The only way I've been able to cut myself is if I try to cut through the root with a quick motion. It helps to cut the root off first, and then cut the rest. \u2013\u00a0 Just Some Guy Aug 28 '15 at 16:38\nI think that the problem is not sharpness of the knife, but your technique. Most probably you are making quick cuts, where the knife needs time to come to rest. Try to cut slowly and deliberately, don't make quick cuts. This will give your knife time to come to rest and also help you avoid cutting yourself.\nI know that when I used to make quick cuts, I have cut myself quite often, but I don't cut myself anymore.\nJust for reference, I used to cut myself frequently, but I haven't cut myself in quite a while, and I don't think I've cut myself since I started using a French knife. \u2013\u00a0 Just Some Guy Aug 28 '15 at 16:37\nI don't think technique is the problem. I do it slowly and deliberately. I'm pretty sure my knife is sharp. I have cut myself when dicing over a cutting board, a plate, a cutting board with a towel under it, and a cutting board with a towel on top of it. I think it has to do with the angle that I'm holding my knife at. I might try dicing on a plate with a different angle. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 16:38\nI'm also 99% confident my knife is sharp. The only way I can cut myself is when I cut through the root. \u2013\u00a0 Just Some Guy Aug 28 '15 at 16:39\nI do it over a cutting board, and I don't have any problems. You should try to cut it on a cutting board. \u2013\u00a0 justhalf Aug 28 '15 at 17:05\nI think that you are trying to cut the root too fast. Try to cut the onions slower and in smaller pieces. You should find the pace where you can cut the onion smoothly, without cutting yourself. \u2013\u00a0 user128826 Aug 28 '15 at 17:26\nYou need a sharp knife, and a proper grip. The grip is important; you need to hold the knife in such a way that your fingers are not in the way of the blade. Then you need to hold the onion firmly, so that as you cut it, it doesn't slip and cut you. You also need to be careful not to cut all the way through the onion, if you're holding it in one hand, as the weight of the blade will cut you.\nI don't use a cutting board when dicing onions, but I do use one when I'm cutting the onion into strips. This is because the strips tend to slip under my fingers, whereas when I'm dicing them, I'm careful to hold them firmly in place.\nI don't use a cutting board when dicing onions, but I do use one when I'm cutting the onion into strips.

Cutting into strips is exactly the same as dicing, but cutting the strips into cubes. \u2013\u00a0 user128826 Aug 28 '15 at 17:29\n@user128826 Yes, it is technically the same thing. However, I find that I cut myself when trying to cut the strips and they slip. I have yet to cut myself when cutting the strips and holding them still. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:31\n@Justin: The problem is not the strips, but how you cut them. You need to hold the strips in place, and cut slowly, so that you don't cut yourself. \u2013\u00a0 user128826 Aug 28 '15 at 17:33\nI usually cut my onions into strips and then dice. I find it much easier to hold them still. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:33\nI use a cutting board with a damp towel underneath it. It helps to keep the onion in place while cutting. \u2013\u00a0 user128826 Aug 28 '15 at 17:35\nI have this same problem. I find that my hand is in the way of the blade when I'm trying to cut the root off of the onion. I'll try cutting the root off on my cutting board to see if that helps. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 16:55\nAre you trying to cut the root in one motion (i.e. in one downward motion, holding the knife vertically)? If so, that's not a good idea. You really want to have the knife come to a stop on the board before the knife comes to a stop in your hand. \u2013\u00a0 Just Some Guy Aug 28 '15 at 16:58\nI tried to cut the root in one motion, but I think I did it with a downward motion. I'll try cutting the root on my cutting board with a downward motion. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:00\nI've never had an issue with cutting onions, but I've found that cutting ginger is a real pain. I can't cut a slice of ginger without cutting myself. I will try to cut the root off of the onion on my cutting board to see if that helps. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:01\nThanks. I'll try cutting the root off on my cutting board and see if that helps. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:03\nIt's probably not the knife. I've had the same problem and have been using the same knife for over 15 years. I've also been able to cut myself with a spoon, but that's an entirely different story.\nI think it's the angle of the knife. I have a good grip on the knife and I'm careful to hold the onion in place. When I've cut myself, it's usually when I'm cutting through the root. I think the angle of the knife is different when I'm cutting through the root. I'll try cutting through the root on my cutting board or a plate to see if that helps. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:12\nI have had that happen to me before. I was cutting the onion on my cutting board, but I was holding the knife at an angle that caused it to cut me. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:13\nI think I was holding my knife at an angle that caused it to cut me. I'll try to hold my knife at a different angle when I'm cutting through the root. \u2013\u00a0 Justin Aug 28 '15 at 17:15\nI have tried cutting through the root on my cutting board while holding a towel, and I still cut myself.
